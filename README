This is a port/remake of an old online game I used to play based on the code here:

https://github.com/Deceth/Battle-City

Very much a work in progress / hobby project

Basic playable version of the client here:

Arrow Keys move, Shift to shoot

Multiplayer will not run without a server running and js changed

# Development

## Client

- cd ./client
- npm install
- npm run dev  # starts Vite dev server on http://localhost:8020
- npm run build  # optional production build to ./client/dist

## Server

- cd ./server
- npm start  # Express + Socket.IO on http://localhost:8021
- npm run dev  # optional: auto-restart with nodemon

## Bot Client

- cd ./bot
- npm install
- node index.js --server http://localhost:8021 --city 0  # joins the server as a roaming recruit bot
- The game server now auto-launches a bot process for each fake city (via the same script), so make sure `npm install` has been run in `bot/` before starting the server.
