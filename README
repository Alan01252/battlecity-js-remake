This is a port/remake of an old online game I used to play based on the code here:

https://github.com/Deceth/Battle-City

Very much a work in progress / hobby project

Basic playable version of the client here:

https://alanhollis.com/battlecity-js-remake/

Multiplayer will not run without a server running and js changed
