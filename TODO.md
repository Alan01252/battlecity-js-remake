# TODO

- **Account & Login Flow** — The legacy client required credentialed login, supported account creation/editing, and provided email-based recovery while the server validated users against a SQLite store and ban list. (`original/Battle-City/client/CLogin.cpp:35`, `original/Battle-City/client/CNew.cpp:45`, `original/Battle-City/client/CRecover.cpp:33`, `original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:25`, `original/Battle-City/server/CDatabase.cpp:48`) The JS remake auto-assigns anonymous sockets with no persistence hook. (`client/src/lobby/LobbyManager.js:407`, `server/src/PlayerFactory.js:105`)
- **Player Progression & Rankings** — Original gameplay tracked cumulative points, deaths, assists, monthly totals, and triggered promotions that were broadcast to every client. (`original/Battle-City/server/CAccount.cpp:514`, `original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:223`, `original/Battle-City/server/NetMessages.h:63`) The current `game.player` state has no scoring fields and the socket layer never listens for points updates. (`client/app.js:170`, `client/src/SocketListener.js:34`)
- **City Staffing, Interviews, and Leadership Management** — The Win32 client exposed a meeting hall with city listings, mayor-led interviews, hire/deny flows, and succession controls, all backed by server-side job application handling. (`original/Battle-City/client/CMeeting.cpp:70`, `original/Battle-City/client/CInterview.cpp:35`, `original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:411`, `original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:528`, `original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:1160`) The remake lobby simply auto-assigns mayors/recruits with no hiring dialog, firings, or successor selection. (`client/src/lobby/LobbyManager.js:407`, `server/src/PlayerFactory.js:105`)
- **Communication Systems** — Legacy Battle City supported rich messaging: lobby chat, in-city walkie channels, mayor comms during interviews, global broadcasts, whispers, and rolling news updates. (`original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:43`, `original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:45`, `original/Battle-City/client/CMeeting.cpp:70`, `original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:355`) The JS socket listener only wires gameplay and lobby events and exposes no chat UI. (`client/src/SocketListener.js:34`, `client/app.js:151`)
- **Admin & Moderation Suite** — Administrators could kick, warp, summon, ban/unban players, spawn items, edit accounts, and update news or starting cities through dedicated dialogs. (`original/Battle-City/client/CAdmin.cpp:40`, `original/Battle-City/client/CAdminEdit.cpp:35`, `original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:1189`) None of these command handlers or UIs exist in the Node server or client socket wiring. (`server/app.js:206`, `client/src/SocketListener.js:320`)
- **Auto-Build & Build Tree Management** — The classic client/server toggled automatic building queues and enforced research-driven build trees server-side. (`original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:360`, `original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:352`) The remake’s building factory only reacts to manual placement and lacks any auto-build toggles or server validation hooks. (`client/src/factories/BuildingFactory.js:118`, `server/src/BuildingFactory.js:47`)
- **Warp / Resync Handshake & Sector Streaming** — Legacy networking warped desynced players, delivered staged sector snapshots, and used the `smNextStep` handshake before entering the battlefield. (`original/Battle-City/server/CProcess.cpp:565`, `original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:258`, `original/Battle-City/server/NetMessages.h:66`) The current socket handlers never emit or process warp/next-step events, so resync tooling is absent. (`client/src/SocketListener.js:34`, `server/src/PlayerFactory.js:105`)
- **City Alerting & Status Notifications** — Mayors previously received `smUnderAttack`, `smNowOrbable`, and related warnings alongside right-click city data pushed from the server. (`original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:208`, `original/Battle-City/client/CProcess.cpp:365`, `original/Battle-City/server/NetMessages.h:85`) The JS client only requests city info on demand and has no proactive alert events wired up. (`client/src/SocketListener.js:34`, `client/src/input/input-mouse.js:72`)
